This is a C# wrapper for the core SDK that performs election functions such as vote encryption, decryption, key generation, and tallying. This code is meant to be run on voting system hardware and to be integrated into existing (or new) voting system software. The ElectionGuard SDK is meant to add end-to-end verifiability and encryption into 3rd party comprehensive voting systems. 

This repository is pre-release. We look forward to engaging with the elections, security, and software engineering communities to continue to improve it as we move towards a full release.

## Building

### C-Implementation Submodule
For each platform, the C-Implementation in the submodule must be built first.
The instructions vary per platform.

1. Initialize the submodule
2. Navigate to `libs\ElectionGuard-SDK-C-Implementation`
3. Follow platform specific instructions

#### Linux

1. Install cmake and gmp (`sudo apt-get install cmake libgmp3-dev`)
2. `cmake -S . -B build -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON`
3. `cmake --build build`
4. `libelectionguard.so` should be created

#### MacOS (.dylib)

1. Install cmake and gmp (`brew install cmake gmp`)
2. `cmake -S . -B build -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON`
3. `cmake --build build`
4. `libelectionguard.dylib` is created

#### Windows (.dll)

1. Install cmake and gmp ([Use Step 1 from Windows Instructions for C-Implementation](https://github.com/microsoft/ElectionGuard-SDK-C-Implementation/blob/master/README-windows.md))
2. `cmake -S . -B build -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON`
3. `cmake --build build`
4. `electionguard.dll` is created

### C# Library Solution
_Note: This build will copy the library created by the submodule build._

Use Visual Studio or `dotnet build` to build.


## Testing

_Warning: Prior to testing, the submodule and the solution must be built in correct order._

Use `dotnet test` to start unit tests or Visual Studio Test Explorer.
